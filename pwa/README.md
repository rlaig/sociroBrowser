<link rel="manifest" href="robrowser.webmanifest">
```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>

* `short_name`: Short name to be shown on the home screen.

* `description`: A sentence or two explaining what your app does.

* `display`: How the app is displayed; can be `fullscreen`, `standalone`, `minimal-ui`, or `browser`.

* `theme_color`: A primary color for the UI, used by operating system.
